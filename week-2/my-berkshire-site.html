  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    It was a lot of fun to be able to use the HTML I had learned to create an actual site.  It was interesting to be able to see a site and try to come up with what the HTML code might look like from behind the scenes.
  - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    Researching and using HTML5 elements was quite easy.  There are a lot of available resources online which makes it quick to pick up new elements.
  - How did you do at keeping at best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    I was able to be consistent with sticking to the best practices.  I haven't had too much experience with styling using CSS so it was quite easy to not apply any of the formatting in the actual HTML.
  - What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML seems like a great way to be able to define the meaning of each piece of code.  The bad part of it would be that it is very verbose and I can see it adding a lot of complexity for more tricky web sites.
  - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    The main trick I think of is the head and the body.  I like to think of a person and the head contains all of the information about the person while the body contains all of the content.  It's not a perfect analogy but putting it to a visual helped me to remember it.
