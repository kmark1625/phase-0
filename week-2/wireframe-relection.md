# Reflection
* **What is a wireframe?**
	* A wireframe is a blueprint of your web site.  This allows you to layout the content of your web page in order to determine where all of the content will be placed.  This is also an opportunity for you to determine how the user will interact with the web page.  You can place content areas on the wireframe as well as links,  buttons, or images.  
* **What are the benefits of wireframing?**
	* A wireframe allows you to make a quick, conceptual design of the web site without having to write the code neccessary for a working web page.  A wireframe is a convenient way to share your ideas as well as to quickly test out the look and feel of different layouts  A wireframe also makes coding of the actual website much easier as you are able to visualize how all of the elements interact with each other.  
* **Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
	* I really enjoyed wireframing my site.  It was easy put together a quick wireframe that actually looks good.  I also enjoyed playing around with different layouts and different elements to determine how they would look on the page.  The work done on the wireframe will also make coding the actual site a lot easier.  
* **Did you revise your wireframe or stick with the first idea?**
	* I revised the initial wireframe idea I had.  I wanted to have four different content boxes displayed on the main page.  After creating this design in a wireframe, I realized that it was very clunky and confusing to a user.  It also was not consistent with the main workflow I wanted an end-user to follow.  I ended up revising the wireframe to have a single main content area which can display different content, such as a blog post or a project description.
* **What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
	* I was unclear what wireframe tools were the best to create a quick wireframe.  I was able to use the site https://gomockingbird.com in order to create a quick wireframe that still looked good.  
* **Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
	* I enjoyed the entire process of creating a wireframe and seeing how the final result looked.  Testing out different designs was a bit tedious.  I can imagine it being a lot of work if you must create a wireframe sketch for a really large, complex website as well as define how pages are linked together.
