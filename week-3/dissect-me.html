  * What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    Throughout this challengs we used a lot of the standard sectioning elements such as <div>, <header>, <footer>, and <article>.  We continue you to return to all of these as they are the basis for content on all pages - almost every page has a header and a footer or sections that must be split off.

  * How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    Elements get laid out on a page based on their display type.  Different elements have different display types by default.  For example, <h1> and <p> elements are block elements and will be displayed in their own line.  Other elements are inline elements, such as <em> and will be placed in flow with the other elements in the page.

  * What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    I learned that sublime can be used to create helpful "snippet" shortcuts for certain commands.  This seems analogous to the "alias" function in unix as it lets you quickly reproduce often-used commands.  I think that I will create many more helpful snippets in the future as well as learn shortcuts that already exist.
