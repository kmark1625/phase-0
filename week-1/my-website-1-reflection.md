* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  * To create a repository on GitHub, simply go to the GitHub website and click on "Create new...">"New Repository" near the top right of the screen.  There will be a clone url on the right sidebar of the repository page.  From the command line enter the command "git clone <url>" in order to clone the repository onto your local desktop.   
* Describe what open source means.
  * Open Source means the source code is available and can be shared and used by others.  Other users are then able to make updates to the code and even distribute the source code.  This methodology is often used by non-profit organizations and rely on collaboration from the community.  Other companies try to make money by offering services for their open-source software.    
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  * I like the sense of open collaboration that comes from a project or product being open source.  I think there are certainly areas where it makes more sense than others to have your code be open source.  
* Assess the importance of using licenses.
  * A license gives permissions to others to use your work.  It is important because it gives you credit for your contributions and is means for preventing others from stealing your work.  Licensing gives a lot more value to sharing your source code online as you are still able to claim the rights to it.  
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  * This challenge helped me have a better overall sense of the differences between git and github. I now am a lot more familiar with the process of cloning the GitHub repository onto my local machine, making updates to the Git Repository, and then pushing those updates back to GitHub.  My big "aha" moment was finally gaining and understanding of how Open Source software works and why it is often-times in a companies best interest to have their source code be available to the public.  I struggled with understanding the differences between the various types of Open Source licenses and when you might choose to use one type of licensing over another.   
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  * The following website had a great graphic on the differences between various OpenSource licenses: [choosealicense.com/licenses/](choosealicense.com/licenses/).
