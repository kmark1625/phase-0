# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I learned about several productivity and time management tactics that I'm itching to test out - such as meditation, emotional awareness, and starting small.  The big takeaway I had from looking through the wide range of topics is that there can be great benefits (to mood and productivity) from implementing small habits.  Even a couple minutes of meditation a day can result in improved focus, memory, and creativity throughout the day.  Similarly, focusing on one small task at a time can help you stay focused and find more enjoyment in day-to-day work.  

One of my favorite quotes that I took away from the reading is "confidence is displayed ability".  I had always heard of the mantra "fake it till you become it", but that never really clicked with me until realizing that confidence is just the ability to produce a correct action.  I know that this will be a very important lesson for me as I go into the bootcamp as well as the software industry, as there will be many things that I won't know.  I'll be able to rely on acting like a "professional developer" by following various best practices for development and writing good code.  

Time boxing is setting aside a static amount of time to achieve a given goal and then evaluating progress at the end of the time.  For example, you can assign yourself the task of completing a homework assignment in 25 minutes and not allow any further work once the time has elapsed.  This helps by focusing your attention on a single task and can produce work that is "good enough" rather than perfect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in the realm of software development.  I currently employ the pomodoro method as a means for estimating how long a given task will take as well as measuring my overall productivity day-to-day and week-to-week.  It works well as a benchmark, however, there are other strategies I can include as part of my workflow that may improve my productivity.

I intend to further use time boxing and set aside a short period of time every morning and evening to due some quick meditation.  I will use this in conjunction with the pomodoro method to determine whether this has a positive effect on my productivity and mood.  I will also have a greater emphasis on explicitly writing out tasks to accomplish and giving myself a set amount of pomodoros to complete the task.  I will then review my progress at the end of the session.  My hope is that this will give me increased focus during the fixed timebox and allow me to complete more work.  My overall plan is to give myself a set number of hours to complete phase 0 material and try to achieve my goals each week.
